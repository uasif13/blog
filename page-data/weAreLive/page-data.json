This will make sure that the blog is constantly updated.</p>\n<p>I want to build out a projects page as well that showcases tiles with succient descriptions of my work. </p>\n<p>I want to build out a lot of React pages and applications and become a boss in CSS. </p>\n<p>Lets build a couple showcase projects with React. I have three on my mind.</p>\n<p>The first one is to use the Gmail API and Mapbox API to create a dashboard of Promed Digest Summaries. I hope to have a map interface and a filter that allows the user to choose a specific disease or time period of alerts on merging diseases.</p>\n<p>The second one is to make a poker game. This one is to test and learn the advanced css techniques that folks seem to use which could easily replace most css frameworks such as Bootstrap. I plan on first making the core game and then adding the following animations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shuffling</li>\n<li>Dealing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>More to come.</p>\n<p>These would be deployed to <a href=\"http://uasif13.github.io/projects/surveillance\">http://uasif13.github.io/projects/surveillance</a> and <a href=\"http://uasif13.github.io/projects/poker\">http://uasif13.github.io/projects/poker</a>. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I AM LIVE!!!","date":"May 29, 2021","description":"Blog has been published to uasif13.github.io/blog"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/firstPost/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"First Post"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"2e7081e3-5b60-5dc9-8455-bbd887b1234c","previousPostId":"1f3ecfbd-820d-5df0-8a55-2ab441005f85","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["230163734","2841359383"]}
