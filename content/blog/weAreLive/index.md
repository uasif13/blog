After completing a tutorial on github actions, I have added an automated script to always build the website for every push to main. This will make sure that the blog is constantly updated.

I want to build out a projects page as well that showcases tiles with succient descriptions of my work. 

I want to build out a lot of React pages and applications and become a boss in CSS. 

Lets build a couple showcase projects with React. I have three on my mind.

The first one is to use the Gmail API and Mapbox API to create a dashboard of Promed Digest Summaries. I hope to have a map interface and a filter that allows the user to choose a specific disease or time period of alerts on merging diseases.

The second one is to make a poker game. This one is to test and learn the advanced css techniques that folks seem to use which could easily replace most css frameworks such as Bootstrap. I plan on first making the core game and then adding the following animations:

1. Shuffling
2. Dealing

More to come.

These would be deployed to http://uasif13.github.io/projects/surveillance and http://uasif13.github.io/projects/poker.
