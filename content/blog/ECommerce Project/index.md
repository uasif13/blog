I started a project to better my skills in fullstack development.

Here's a quick summary of what I want to do:

Make a ECommerce App. Users will have to login. A user can either be a customer or an owner. Customers can view products recommended to them. Owners can add products that they can sell. Owners can see analysis of how their business is performing. Customers can see analysis of their purchasing history.

I've been applying to jobs and I want to build on some key skills that are attractive to employers.

Here is the tech I want to use:

React, AWS, Node.JS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL.

No fancy designs - just a simple app that is deployed on AWS with persistent storage on PostgreSQL. 

So much has changed- create-react-app used to be the standard for building applications with react but now it is next.js.

Things I'm Learning:

Next.Js is a full-stack application that employs react.

React is a library for web and native components. You can not build applications solely with react.

What's an application? An application is- I'm not sure. A platform where people have clear intents on what they want to do.

What does Next.JS have that React does not have? The first thing that came to mind is a bundler. When I was working with three.js, I used parcel to view my components in the web. I don't have a deep understanding of bundlers. All I know is that bundlers take the different javascript files and create a single script file included in the html file. At the end of the day, all these web components are wrappers to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Yes, it would be incredibly difficult to build instagram with just these three but the core technologies are still there. 

Everytime I get a new component with React or Next, try to break it down to the fundamentals.

Link is a wrapper for the a tag (hyperlink). Adds prefetching and server-sided routing. Prefetching loads to cache. This is different than traditional loading which stores it on local memory- I believe.
